Computer Vision
===============

A playground for the Opencv library with Java bindings. This project includes samples for:
 - face detection via Java binding for opencv
 - face recognation with JavaCV
 - Exposure Fusion

Installing OpenCV
-----------------
Please refer [OpenCV's documentation](http://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01-installing-opencv-for-java.html)

Known Issues 
------------
Might work properly on windows only, depending on the version of OpenCV.
It still requires Oracle's Java 8 SDK since there are dependencies to JavaFX.
